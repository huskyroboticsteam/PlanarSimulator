Use SLAM for state estimation in real-time navigation
Implement some kind of *efficient* graph-based optimizer
Read a paper to verify that this is actually how smoothing-based SLAM is implemented
  (in particular, understand why the Hessian of the potential gives the "variance")
Change 1D factor interface to match 2D
Implement partial visibility of landmarks (e.g. obstruction by obstacles)
