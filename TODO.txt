Animate the simulator graphically (and plot odom/smoothed trajectories)
Implement some kind of *efficient* graph-based optimizer
Read a paper to verify that this is actually how smoothing-based SLAM is implemented
  (in particular, understand why the Hessian of the potential gives the "variance")
Remove signedness casts
Clean up world.{h,cpp} data structures
