Use SLAM for state estimation in real-time navigation
Use a more efficient graph-based optimizer (standard variable elimination w/ Levenberg-Marquardt)
Read a paper to verify that this is actually how smoothing-based SLAM is implemented
  (in particular, understand why the Hessian of the potential gives the "variance")
