FUNCTIONALITY:
  Animate the simulator graphically (and plot odom/smoothed trajectories)
  Implement some kind of *efficient* graph-based optimizer
  Read a paper to verify that this is actually how smoothing-based SLAM is implemented
    (in particular, understand why the Hessian of the potential gives the "variance")
  The graph size N really shouldn't be a compile-time constant.
  Change 1D factor interface to match 2D
